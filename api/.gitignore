# ignore all .log files 
*.logYes, the code in the .gitignore file looks correct to ignore files like node_modules. The lines:
     
     ```
     modules
     .env
     build/
     tmp/
     ```
     
     Will ignore the directories modules/, .env, build/, and tmp/ from being tracked by git.
     
     The line:
     
     ```
     *.log
     ```
     
     Will ignore any files ending in .log from being tracked.
     
     So this .gitignore file properly configures git to ignore common directories and files like node_modules that don't need to be committed to version control.
