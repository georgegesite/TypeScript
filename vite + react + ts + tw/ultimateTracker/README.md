# Learning React + Vite + JavaScript + Tailwind

I am learning how to build web applications using:

- React - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Vite - A fast build tool that provides hot module replacement
- JavaScript - The core programming language
- Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework for styling

I am excited to continue building projects with these technologies to improve my skills as a web developer.

I dont know what to build anymore, I have lost motivation
Sometimes I want to code something, but I dont know what to code
