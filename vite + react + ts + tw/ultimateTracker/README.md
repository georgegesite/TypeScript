# Learning React + Vite + JavaScript + Tailwind

I am learning how to build web applications using:

- React - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Vite - A fast build tool that provides hot module replacement
- JavaScript - The core programming language
- Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework for styling

I am excited to continue building projects with these technologies to improve my skills as a web developer.

I dont know what to build anymore, I have lost motivation
Sometimes I want to code something, but I dont know what to code

Programming is so boring sometimes. There are days were you just don't have the motivation to code. Some days, you just get tired of facing the same problem.
But that's okay programming is an art form, stress will always be there and it's important to take a break sometimes.

What I learned is that it's not about the quantity but the quality of the work, so some projects I thought of are just so basic, so I lack the motivation to implement them.
Right now I'm trying to brainstorm a project that is useful to me and probably is aided with AI or ML.
I could use Generative AI to meet the needs I want like the video I watched by David Bombal about how AI helps in your daily life.
I think that is just my journal for Today, I dont have the motivation to code, but I can say what I think and I don't care for the judgement I'm receiving to the people reading this, peace out yo!
